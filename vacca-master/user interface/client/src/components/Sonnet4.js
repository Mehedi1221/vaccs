                <b>Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E)</b> is a species of coronavirus which
                infects humans and bats.[1] It is an enveloped, positive-sense,
                single-stranded RNA virus which enters its host cell by binding
                to the APN receptor.[2] Along with Human coronavirus OC43
                (a member of the Betacoronavirus genus), it is one of the viruses responsible for the common cold.
                [3][4] HCoV-229E is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus and subgenus Duvinacovirus.

            <h1 style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>Signs and symptoms</h1>
            <p style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}><b>HCoV-229E</b> is associated with a range of respiratory symptoms,
                ranging from the common cold to high-morbidity outcomes such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
                However, such high morbidity outcomes are almost always seen in cases with
                co-infection with other respiratory pathogens;
                there is a single published case report to date of a 229E infection
                that caused acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in an otherwise
                healthy patient having no detectable co-infection with another pathogen.
                [7] HCoV-229E is also among the coronaviruses most frequently codetected with
                other respiratory viruses, particularly with human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV)

                HCoV-229E is one of the seven human coronaviruses which include HCoV-NL63,
                HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1,
                and SARS-CoV-2 and are globally distributed.[11][12]
                However, the viruses were detected in different parts of
                the world at different times of the year.[13][14][15] A NCBI-study
                found a previous HCoV-229E infection in 42.9% – 50.0% of children of 6–12 months
                of age and in 65% of those 2.5–3.5 years of age
